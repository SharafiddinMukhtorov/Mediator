# Mediatr Example Project

A simple C# project demonstrating the **Mediator pattern** using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR).  
This project is designed for developers who want to understand **Mediator** and see a clean implementation in a real-world scenario.

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- Implements **Mediator pattern** with `IRequest` and `IRequestHandler`.
- Includes **Query** and **Command** examples.
- Demonstrates **dependency injection** of `IMediator` in ASP.NET Core.
- Provides a simple **Cars API** to showcase Mediator in action.
- Easy to extend and adapt for learning or real projects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Navigate to the project folder**
3. **Restore dependencies and run the project**
4. **Open Swagger UI in your browser**


## ðŸ“š Why Mediator?

The **Mediator pattern** is useful for:

- **Reducing tight coupling** between controllers and services.  
- **Promoting Single Responsibility Principle**, keeping code clean and maintainable.  
- **Making unit testing easier** by testing handlers independently.  
- **Working seamlessly with CQRS** (Command/Query Responsibility Segregation).  

This helps developers write **modular, testable, and scalable applications**.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

By exploring this project, you will learn:

- How to structure **requests and handlers** using Mediator.  
- How to integrate **MediatR** into ASP.NET Core projects.  
- How to separate **business logic from controllers**.  
- Best practices for building **maintainable and testable C# applications**.
